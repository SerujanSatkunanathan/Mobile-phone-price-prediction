Mobile Phone Price Prediction

  This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the price range of mobile phones based on various features such as battery power,RAM, and storage.
  The model helps in categorizing mobile phones into different price segments, providing a valuable tool for users or businesses to make informed decisions.

Project Overview

  In this project, we use a dataset containing mobile phone specifications and employ machine learning algorithms to predict the price range.
  This can help users, retailers, and manufacturers understand the correlation between mobile phone features and their market prices.

Features used for prediction:

  Battery Power,
  RAM,
  Internal Storage,
  Display Size,
  Camera Quality,
  Processor Speed,
  Number of Cores

Technologies Used:

  Python,
  Scikit-learn,
  Pandas,
  NumPy,
  Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization),
  Jupyter Notebook  

Results

  After training and evaluating multiple models, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy for predicting the price range of mobile phones.

Future Work

  Enhance feature selection for better accuracy.
  Incorporate deep learning techniques for improved predictions.
  Deploy the model as a web-based service using FastAPI or Flask.
